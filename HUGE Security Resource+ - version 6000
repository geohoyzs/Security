 ===============================================================
      HUGE Security Resource+ - version 6000 - 08/31/2012
                   (Security + Trimmings!)

,.-----> CHANGELOG:
|
| 1. Added a crazy amount of new links.
| 2. Fixed 'OpenBSD' links incorrectly assigned to previous section 5000
| 3. Merged 'Security Blogs' at bottom to proper section 6005
| 4. Removed most titles/descriptions of links to reduce clutter & ease use
|    While this may make it more difficult to find exactly what you're
|    after, it's cleaner, leaner, and easier to navigate through. This
|    is especially true for the guys maintaining this document. There is
|    some labeling/titles here and there, but most of the heavily
|    verbose titles/descriptions of various entries have been removed.
| 5. Merged 'Pubs' & 'Forums' to 6007 & 6006
| 6. Removed several duplicate and broken links
| 7. Fixed some links (pages had moved) and a few typos
| 8. Sorta sorted sections
| 9. Renamed project title from 'HUGE Security Resource' to
|    'HUGE Security Resource+', meaning, with this version and
|    future versions this document will contain more than
|    security related material. (currently a work in progress)
|10. Released v.6000 despite a large number of remaining links we
|    would like to include, but they will come with our next release.

This is the end of HUGE Security Resource+ - version 6000 - 08/31/2012
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We post this publication first at PasteBin.com. Please stay tuned
for the next version of HUGE Security Resource+. It's not the best
of names for a publication, but we're lazy, and this is free for
you.

We do not name, credit, or otherwise pimp out who we are. None of us
will ever claim credit for this document, previous, present, and future
versions, anyone who does is lying.

We're not on Facebook, Twitter, or any other whore social media circles,
nor are we active in the traditional and non traditional areas
of chatter - including IRC. Every version of this document
has, is, and will be released as a text file because it's
easier to share with friends and it lacks ugly metadata.

Please share this document with others, convert it to PDF
and other formats, but please do not modify the document
from its original design. Do not add your own links
for redistribution, rename the document, or claim that
you wrote it. Please provide a link back to the original
location @ PasteBin where it's released first.

We don't want anything other than to provide you with a solid
list of specially chosen sites. Anyone can toss together a
document with links, but we stay on the hunt for useful links,
for quality links. It takes time to harvest, prepare, and
print new links, especially when we have to check the previously
posted links to ensure they are alive and at the same location
and if not, we bring the links up to date. Some links are archives,
some lead directly to PDF files. Surely you've noticed as we've
made it quite simple to navigate this document with tagging
special URLs.

A few of the blogs linked within this document haven't been updated
in awhile, but they remain as a useful archive of information
generated in past entries, and some bloggers go several weeks,
months, or a year before returning to their blogs. This does
not bring down the quality of the blogs linked within, as
the chosen ones published here were selected on the basis
of quality.

We'd like to say thanks to CRYPTOME who has been linking
to our official release pages at PasteBin shortly after
we release a new version. Thanks Cryptome! And thank you
to PASTEBIN!
----------------------------------------

When this document began, in previous versions, it was previously
known as: HUGE List of Security Blogs: Unix, Linux, Windows,
part 1, 2, 3, and 4 and changed document names with version
5000. With version 6000 we renamed the project title from
'HUGE Security Resource' to 'HUGE Security Resource+',
meaning, with this version and future versions this document will
contain more than security related material.
(currently a work in progress)

=========================================================
Consideration #1: Are crossword puzzles and similar puzzles
published in print simply devices to alter the brain by
inserting carefully prepared words, phrases, and
numbers into your thought processes in order to trigger
or establish some type of action, or... connection.. to
something?

Consideration #2: What if all secret agencies were of one
accord spiritually, like in the paintings of dogs playing
poker, just using humanity to play out one big game of
destruction and domination with humans as the visible and
spiritual puppets?
